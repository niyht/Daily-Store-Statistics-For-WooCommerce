With this plugin, you can access the statistics of the people who enter your site daily, which I have listed below:

Number of people visiting the site<br>
Number of people visiting the product page<br>
Number of products added to cart<br>
Number of people who saw the cart page<br>
Number of people who saw the payment page<br>

The product page part may not work very well if you have wp-rocket installed on your site and you are using the caching feature.
