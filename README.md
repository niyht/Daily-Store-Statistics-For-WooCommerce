With this plugin, you can access the statistics of the people who enter your site daily, which I have listed below:

Number of people visiting the site
Number of people visiting the product page
Number of products added to cart
Number of people who saw the cart page
Number of people who saw the payment page

The product page part may not work very well if you have wp-rocket installed on your site and you are using the caching feature.
